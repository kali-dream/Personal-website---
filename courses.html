                    <h3>CST8116 - Introduction to Computer Programming</h3>
                    <p>Possessing the fundamentals of logic, problem-solving and programming language structure provides a solid foundation for further study in the field. Students develop introductory knowledge of computer programming with emphasis on problem analysis and design, using algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and testing, with the Java programming language used as a means to implement problem solution designs. Through an introduction to the Java programming language students use sequential structures, selection structures, repetition structures, variables, constants, methods, constructors, one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming, classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, inputs, outputs, coding conventions and documentation. Theory is reinforced with application by means of practical laboratory assessments.</p>

                    <h3>CST8118 - Computer Essentials</h3>
                    <p>Maintaining a computer, using operating system and productivity software, and expressing related environmental and sustainability concerns, is an important part of working with Information Technology. Students explain computer hardware, and use operating system software to maintain, utilize, and secure a computer. Students practice the use of spreadsheet software to solve problems, use formulas, and visualize data with charts. Students discuss computer hardware and software with regards to financial and environmental sustainability. Theory is reinforced with application by means of practical laboratory assessments, including using virtualization software to install guest operating systems onto a host computer.

                    <h3>CST8215 - Introduction to Database</h3>
                    <p>Databases are used to store data and are a core component of many information technology systems. Students learn the fundamentals of relational databases design using Entity Relation Diagrams (ERDs), and use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, modify and query a database. Students design and create databases that are maintainable, secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using normalization. Students become familiar with the functions of a Database Management System (DBMS) and its components in comparison with legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.</p>
